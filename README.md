[fortran-shlex](https://github.com/perazz/fortran-shlex): port by Federico Perini of Python's [shlex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html) shell-like lexer. The interface comes with two functions, `split` which parses a command-like string and returns an array of allocatable character strings; and `shlex` that performs the same, but returns a list of `type(shlex_token)` tokens.
