[forgex](https://github.com/ShinobuAmasaki/forgex): regular expression engine using a deterministic finite automaton ([DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton)) approach, by Shinobu Amasaki. It provides `.in.` and `.match.` operators to detect if a pattern is contained in or exactly matches a string.

[fortran202x_split](https://github.com/milancurcic/fortran202x_split): Fortran implementation of the Fortran 202X split intrinsic subroutine, by Milan Curcic and Sebastian Ehlert

[fortran-pcre2](https://github.com/interkosmos/fortran-pcre2): Fortran 2018 ISO_C_BINDING interfaces to Perl-compatible Regular Expressions 2 (PCRE2), by interkosmos

[fortran-regex](https://github.com/perazz/fortran-regex): port by Federico Perini of the [tiny-regex-c](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-regex-c) library for regular expressions. It is based on the original C implementation, but the API is modelled in Fortran style, which is similar to the intrinsic index function.

[fortran-shlex](https://github.com/perazz/fortran-shlex): port by Federico Perini of Python's [shlex](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html) shell-like lexer. The interface comes with two functions, `split` which parses a command-like string and returns an array of allocatable character strings; and `shlex` that performs the same, but returns a list of `type(shlex_token)` tokens.

[Fortran-String-to-Real](https://github.com/Carltoffel/Fortran-String-to-Real): converts strings to reals without using an internal read, by Carltoffel. [Fortran-String-to-Num](https://github.com/jalvesz/Fortran-String-to-Num) is a fork by jalvesz that aims for further improvements on the ASCII to numerical data conversion.

[Fregex](https://github.com/14NGiestas/fregex): Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) wrapper for Fortran by Ian Giestas Pauli

[fsys](https://github.com/jchristopherson/fsys): library by Jason Christopherson containing system operations and supporting types: `string`, similar to the `iso_varying_string`, but with a few differences and a few additional operations, and `string_builder`, a type that allows concatenating strings while minimizing memory reallocation operations, that behaves similarily to the .NET `StringBuilder` class

[iso_varying_string](https://github.com/everythingfunctional/iso_varying_string): implementation of the ISO_VARYING_STRING module as defined in the ISO standard, by Brad Richardson

[M_io](https://github.com/urbanjost/M_io): collection of procedures that create a simple interface for common I/O tasks not conveniently done with intrinsic I/O procedures, by urbanjost

[M_match](https://github.com/urbanjost/M_match): basic implementation in Fortran of a subset of regular expressions as described in "Software Tools" by Kernighan and Plauger, 1976.

[M_regex](https://github.com/urbanjost/M_regex): Fortran interface by urbanjost to the POSIX 1003.2 regular expression library using ISO_C_BINDING

[M_strings](https://github.com/urbanjost/M_strings): modules for processing strings. Routines for parsing, tokenizing, changing case, substituting new strings for substrings, locating strings with simple wildcard expressions, removing tabs and line terminators and other string manipulations are included

[parff](https://github.com/everythingfunctional/parff): functional style parser combinator library, by Brad Richardson and Patrick Raynaud. By using a library like this, it is possible to implement parsers for complex formats by composing independent little pieces. 

[ryu_fortran](https://github.com/St-Maxwell/ryu_fortran): Ryu algorithm which converts floating point numbers to decimal strings, by St Maxwell. It is more effective than internal file approach. This implementation is based on the Scala version of Ryu.

[scanner](https://github.com/freevryheid/scanner): text scanner for parsing, by Andre Smit

[strff](https://github.com/everythingfunctional/strff): library of string functions, by Brad Richardson

[StringiFor](https://github.com/szaghi/StringiFor): Strings Fortran Manipulator with steroids, by szaghi

[strith](https://github.com/degawa/strith): converts a variable representing a long integer into a string by performing arithmetic operations on numbers in strings, by Tomohiro Degawa

[utf8-f](https://github.com/St-Maxwell/utf8-f): UTF-8 manipulation, by St-Maxwell. The underlying data in a utf8_string object is a deferred-length string of <br>`character(len=:, kind=c_char)` type.

## Time Series

[fortsa](https://github.com/zoziha/fortsa): univariate time series analysis and ARIMA modeling package, by zoziha

[spectrum](https://github.com/jchristopherson/spectrum): library containing signal analysis routines with a focus towards spectral routines, by Jason Christopherson

[wavepack](https://github.com/zoziha/wavepack): computes the wavelet transform of a time series, and significance levels, by zoziha

## Unclassified

[DAGLIB](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/daglib): modern Fortran module for creating and manipulating directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), by Jacob Williams and Damian Rouson. It includes a toposort feature, and also the ability to generate files in the GraphViz "dot" notation.

[strengthcalc](https://github.com/piotrbajdek/strengthcalc): strengthcalc employs mathematical formulae from Mayhew et al. (1992) and Wathen (1994) to estimate the maximum weight one can lift in a single repetition of a physical exercise (known as 1RM: one repetition maximum), by Piotr Bajdek

## Unit Testing

[fordebug](https://github.com/gha3mi/fordebug): library designed for debugging Fortran code, especially within pure procedures, by Seyed Ali Ghasemi

[fortran_test_helper](https://github.com/jchristopherson/fortran_test_helper): library to provide assistance to testing, by Jason Christopherson

[M_framework](https://github.com/urbanjost/M_framework): aggregate of Fortran modules useful for creating terminal messages, comparing expected values to results, writing logfiles and playback journals and performing unit tests for Fortran, by urbanjost

[par-funnel](https://github.com/degawa/par-funnel): unit test parameterizer using namelist, by Tomohiro Degawa. Par-funnel is not a unit test framework but is intended to be used with other unit test frameworks.

[test-drive](https://github.com/fortran-lang/test-drive): lightweight, procedural unit testing framework based on nothing but standard Fortran, by Sebastian Ehlert and Jeremie Vandenplas. Integration with meson, cmake and Fortran package manager (fpm) is available.

[Veggies](https://github.com/everythingfunctional/veggies): unit testing framework written using functional programming principles, with the ability to test parallel code, by Brad Richardson et al. As many of its procedures as possible are marked with the pure keyword, while still allowing the framework to test impure code. 

## Web Programming

[github-org-analyzer](https://github.com/rajkumardongre/github-org-analyzer): procedures to analyze GitHub organizations and retrieve valuable information about their repositories, by Rajkumar Dongre. By leveraging the power of the http-client package, this analyzer fetches data from the GitHub API to generate insightful reports.
